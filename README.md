# Updated Social Wall

A simple ‚Äúsocial wall‚Äù that aggregates recent posts and renders them in a single, embeddable page. The repo includes lightweight Python utilities for collecting posts, plus static HTML templates to display them.

> Status: work in progress ‚Äî no formal release yet.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Unified feed view: Display posts in a single wall (`social_wall.html`, `index.html`).
- Scraping/handlers provided: Starter scripts for LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter/X.
- Static or server-rendered: Use the static HTML, or host with a small Python web server.
- Sample data: JSON/CSV and sample HTML files to experiment with layout quickly.

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ recommended  
- pip for Python dependencies  
- (Optional) Node.js + npm if you intend to add any front-end tooling referenced by `package.json`

Because there‚Äôs no `requirements.txt` yet, install the libraries you use in the scrapers (typical stack includes `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, maybe `flask` if `social_wall_server.py` serves templates).

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 flask
````

> If your handlers use different libs (e.g., `tweepy`, `playwright`, or `selenium`), install those too.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option A ‚Äî Open the static demo

1. Open `social_wall.html` (or `index.html`) directly in your browser.
2. Use the sample data files to understand the expected markup/JSON shape.

### Option B ‚Äî Run the Python server

If `social_wall_server.py` exposes a small web app (e.g., Flask), run:

```bash
python social_wall_server.py
```

Then visit the local URL it prints (commonly `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

---

## üîå Fetching Posts

> These scripts are prototypes; adapt them to your auth keys, selectors, and rate limits. Scraping may violate platform ToS ‚Äî prefer official APIs where available.

### LinkedIn

File: `linkedin_handler.py`
  Output: `linkedin_posts.json` and/or HTML samples
  Steps:

  1. Configure login/session or API (if you have Enterprise/Partner access).
  2. Update selectors/queries in the script.
  3. Run and verify the JSON/HTML output matches your wall‚Äôs expected shape.

### Instagram

File: `instagram.py`
  Steps:

  1. Choose API vs. scraping approach.
  2. Provide credentials or cookies if needed.
  3. Export normalized JSON with fields like `author`, `timestamp`, `text`, `mediaUrl`, `permalink`.

### Twitter/X

File: `twitter_handler.py`
  Steps:

  1. Configure X API keys (or a headless scraper, if permitted).
  2. Normalize to the same schema as other platforms.

---

## üß± Data Model (suggested)

Unify handlers to emit an array of objects such as:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "platform-specific-id",
    "platform": "linkedin|instagram|twitter",
    "author": "Display Name",
    "username": "@handle",
    "avatar": "https://...",
    "text": "Post content...",
    "media": [{"type": "image|video", "url": "https://..."}],
    "permalink": "https://...",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-01T10:03:00Z"
  }
]
```

This makes your rendering logic simple and consistent.

---

## üé® Rendering the Wall

The provided `social_wall.html`/`templates/` files show how to loop through posts and render cards.
If you serve via Python:

  Load the consolidated JSON (from `linkedin_posts.json`, `social_posts.csv`, etc.).
  Pass it to the template for rendering.
For a static build, you can pre-generate `social_wall.html` by injecting your JSON into the page at build time.

---

## üß™ Development Tips
Start with one platform (e.g., LinkedIn) and verify end-to-end (fetch ‚Üí normalize ‚Üí render).
Keep a small fixture file (e.g., `data/dev-posts.json`) to iterate on HTML/CSS quickly.
Add a `requirements.txt` and (optional) `Makefile` or npm scripts to document dev workflows.
Consider environments/keys via `.env` and `python-dotenv` if using APIs.

---

## üì¶ Roadmap / TODO

[ ] Add `requirements.txt` with exact Python dependencies
[ ] Provide a minimal Flask app (if not already) with `/` ‚Üí wall view
[ ] Add a build step to bundle static assets (optional)
[ ] Formalize a unified `posts.json` schema and a validator
[ ] Add tests for handlers and HTML rendering
[ ] Add a LICENSE file
[ ] Provide Dockerfile for reproducible runs

## ü§ù Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome! Please:

1. Describe the change and why it‚Äôs needed.
2. Include sample data or screenshots.
3. Keep handlers/platform configs out of version control (use `.env`).

## üìÑ License

*No license specified yet.* Add one to clarify usage rights.

```

Want me to tailor this further (e.g., add exact `flask` routes, pin dependencies, or wire in a small JSON loader for the templates)? I can refine it to match the actual code in `social_wall_server.py` and the handlers.
